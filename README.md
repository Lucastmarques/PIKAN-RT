# PIKANRT
PIKANRT is a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for seismic ray tracing in complex geological environments. It combines KANs' compositional structure with PINNs' physics constraints for high accuracy and scalability. PIKANRT achieves $R^2 > 0.98$ and fast inference, offering a robust solution for real-time geophysical modeling.
